This program is a menu-driven Inventory Management System for up to 10 products.
It stores Product ID, Name, Quantity, and Price using parallel arrays.
The user can input products, display all items, and search by ID.
It also calculates total inventory value and finds highest/lowest value products.
The program uses only loops, arrays, and conditionals—no functions or structures.
